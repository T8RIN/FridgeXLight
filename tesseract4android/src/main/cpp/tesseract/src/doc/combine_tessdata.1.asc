COMBINE_TESSDATA(1)
===================

NAME
----
combine_tessdata - combine/extract/overwrite/list/compact Tesseract data

SYNOPSIS
--------
*combine_tessdata* ['OPTION'] 'FILE'...

DESCRIPTION
-----------
combine_tessdata(1) is the main program to combine/extract/overwrite/list/compact
tessdata components in [lang].traineddata files.

To combine all the individual tessdata components (unicharset, DAWGs,
classifier templates, ambiguities, language configs) located at, say,
/home/$USER/temp/eng.* run:

  combine_tessdata /home/$USER/temp/eng.

The result will be a combined tessdata file /home/$USER/temp/eng.traineddata

Specify option -e if you would like to extract individual components
from a combined traineddata file. For example, to extract language config
file and the unicharset from tessdata/eng.traineddata run:

  combine_tessdata -e tessdata/eng.traineddata \
    /home/$USER/temp/eng.config /home/$USER/temp/eng.unicharset

The desired config file and unicharset will be written to
/home/$USER/temp/eng.config /home/$USER/temp/eng.unicharset

Specify option -o to overwrite individual components of the given
[lang].traineddata file. For example, to overwrite language config
and unichar ambiguities files in tessdata/eng.traineddata use:

  combine_tessdata -o tessdata/eng.traineddata \
    /home/$USER/temp/eng.config /home/$USER/temp/eng.unicharambigs

As a result, tessdata/eng.traineddata will contain the new language config
and unichar ambigs, plus all the original DAWGs, classifier templates, etc.

Note: the file names of the files to extract to and to overwrite from should
have the appropriate file suffixes (extensions) indicating their tessdata
component type (.unicharset for the unicharset, .unicharambigs for unichar
ambigs, etc). See k*FileSuffix variable in ccutil/tessdatamanager.h.

Specify option -u to unpack all the components to the specified path:

    combine_tessdata -u tessdata/eng.traineddata /home/$USER/temp/eng.

This will create  /home/$USER/temp/eng.* files with individual tessdata
components from tessdata/eng.traineddata.

OPTIONS
-------

    Extracts the specified components from the .traineddata file

*-l* '.traineddata' 'FILE'...:
   List the network information.

*-o* '.traineddata' 'FILE'...:
    Overwrites the specified components of the .traineddata file
    with those provided on the command line.

*-u* '.traineddata' 'PATHPREFIX'
    Unpacks the .traineddata using the provided prefix.

CAVEATS
-------
'Prefix' refers to the full file prefix, including period (.)


COMPONENTS
----------
The components in a Tesseract lang.traineddata file as of
Tesseract 4.0 are briefly described below; For more information on
many of these files, see
<https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Training-Tesseract.html>
and
<https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/TrainingTesseract-4.00.html>

lang.config::
  (Optional) Language-specific overrides to default config variables.
  For 4.0 traineddata files, lang.config provides control parameters which
  can affect layout analysis, and sub-languages.

lang.unicharset::
  (Required - 3.0x  legacy tesseract) The list of symbols that Tesseract recognizes, with properties.
  See unicharset(5).

lang.unicharambigs::
  (Optional - 3.0x  legacy tesseract) This file contains information on pairs of recognized symbols
  which are often confused.  For example, 'rn' and 'm'.

lang.inttemp::
  (Required - 3.0x  legacy tesseract) Character shape templates for each unichar.  Produced by
  mftraining(1).

lang.pffmtable::
  (Required - 3.0x  legacy tesseract) The number of features expected for each unichar.
  Produced by mftraining(1) from *.tr* files.

lang.normproto::
  (Required - 3.0x  legacy tesseract) Character normalization prototypes generated by cntraining(1)
  from *.tr* files.

lang.punc-dawg::
  (Optional - 3.0x  legacy tesseract) A dawg made from punctuation patterns found around words.
  The "word" part is replaced by a single space.

lang.word-dawg::
  (Optional - 3.0x  legacy tesseract) A dawg made from dictionary words from the language.

lang.number-dawg::
  (Optional - 3.0x  legacy tesseract) A dawg made from tokens which originally contained digits.
  Each digit is replaced by a space character.

lang.freq-dawg::
  (Optional - 3.0x  legacy tesseract) A dawg made from the most frequent words which would have
  gone into word-dawg.

lang.fixed-length-dawgs::
  (Optional - 3.0x  legacy tesseract) Several dawgs of different fixed lengths -- useful for
  languages like Chinese.

lang.shapetable::
  (Optional - 3.0x  legacy tesseract) When present, a shapetable is an extra layer between the character
  classifier and the word recognizer that allows the character classifier to
  return a collection of unichar ids and fonts instead of a single unichar-id
  and font.

lang.bigram-dawg::
  (Optional - 3.0x  legacy tesseract) A dawg of word bigrams where the words are separated by a space
  and each digit is replaced by a '?'.

lang.unambig-dawg::
  (Optional - 3.0x  legacy tesseract) .

lang.params-model::
  (Optional - 3.0x  legacy tesseract) .

lang.lstm::
  (Required - 4.0 LSTM) Neural net trained recognition model generated by lstmtraining.

lang.lstm-punc-dawg::
  (Optional - 4.0 LSTM) A dawg made from punctuation patterns found around words.
  The "word" part is replaced by a single space. Uses lang.lstm-unicharset.

lang.lstm-word-dawg::
  (Optional - 4.0 LSTM) A dawg made from dictionary words from the language.
  Uses lang.lstm-unicharset.

lang.lstm-number-dawg::
  (Optional - 4.0 LSTM) A dawg made from tokens which originally contained digits.
  Each digit is replaced by a space character. Uses lang.lstm-unicharset.

lang.lstm-unicharset::
  (Required - 4.0 LSTM) The unicode character set that Tesseract recognizes, with properties.
  Same unicharset must be used to train the LSTM and build the lstm-*-dawgs files.

lang.lstm-recoder::
  (Required - 4.0 LSTM) Unicharcompress, aka the recoder, which maps the unicharset
  further to the codes actually used by the neural network recognizer. This is created as
  part of the starter traineddata by combine_lang_model.

lang.version::
  (Optional) Version string for the traineddata file.
  First appeared in version 4.0 of Tesseract.
  Old version of traineddata files will report Version:Pre-4.0.0.
  4.0 version of traineddata files may include the network spec
  used for LSTM training as part of version string.
