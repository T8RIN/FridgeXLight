/*
 * binarize_set.c
 *
 *   Does 5 different types of binarization for the contest.
 *
 *   Method 1.  Using local background normalization, followed by
 *              a global threshold.
 *   Method 2.  Using local background normalization, followed by
 *              Otsu on the result to get a global threshold that
 *              can be applied to the normalized image.
 *   Method 3.  Using local background normalization with two different
 *              thresholds.  For the part of the image near the text,
 *              a high threshold can be chosen, to render the text
 *              fully in black.  For the rest of the image,
 *              much of which is background, use a threshold based on
 *              the Otsu global value of the original image.
 *   Method 4.  Contrast normalization followed by Sauvola binarization.
 *   Method 5.  Contrast normalization followed by background normalization
 *              and thresholding.
 *
 *   The first 3 were submitted to a binarization contest associated
 *   with ICDAR in 2009.  The 4th and 5th work better for difficult
 *   images, such as w91frag.jpg.
